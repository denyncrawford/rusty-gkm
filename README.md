This project is a simple bridge for [Deno GKM](https://github.com/denyncrawford/deno-gkm), a global event driver for deno.

This project uses **rdev** for handling native events. Right now, it only can listen to events but there's plans to make it able to trigger events for automation.

Please, consider that this project is my first rust project, so take the development as a learning experience.

## Building

```bash
cargo build
